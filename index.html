                <p>
                  In April 2014, I was given the worst news any mother could receive. It was the first time Abir was diagnosed with Leukemia. Abir was in and out of hospital stays for three long years.He spent much of his early childhood getting poked by needles, giving blood, sleeping in hospital beds and receiving harsh chemotherapy.
                </p>
                <p class="fst-italic">
                  Finally, in June 2017, I finally received news my heart was aching to hear. After 3 years of painful treatments, Abir had finally beat cancer. He could finally live his life like a normal child.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Two days before his birthday, we received the information that my son’s blood cancer had relapsed. None of us had the heart to tell him this so we let him celebrate his birthday in full spirits.</li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> This time we gathered all our belongings and left everything behind, our work, our older son (16 years old at the time), our home, everything to head to New York to seek treatment.</li>

                <p>
                  With immense grief and sadness, we, colleagues, and friends, share the news of the sudden demise of our beloved friend Pravat Kumar Sethy at the age of 44. He was the sole breadwinner for his family, he left behind his elderly parents, his wife Sagarika , and two kids Sai (age – 7) and Shree (11).
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Pravat was working in Kolkata, India. He was diagnosed with COVID and within few days his lungs were badly infected. He was admitted to the hospital, but the situation went out of control for him. Unfortunately, at the end he lost the battle, and we lost our loving friend Pravat on May 1st, 2021.</li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Pravat is a firm follower of doing good deeds and karmas. He is a true hero who went above and beyond to support and entertain his family and friends. He worked in Information Technology and professionally was very sincere and dedicated person. On personal front he was a great son, doting father, husband, friend, colleague, mentor, and well-wisher for many of us. It is very rare to find a person like him who is very humble, down to earth, and always willing to help.</li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> As you can imagine his family is devastated by this loss of a sincere son, loving and caring husband and a responsible father. His wife now faces the task of being the sole caregiver and for the upbringing and education of their two small children. This loss creates a huge financial burden, and we hope to help ease their financial worries with this fundraising. This huge loss for the family cannot be replaced, but we are hoping to do our bit to make things easy in whichever way possible.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="fst-italic">
                  Please pray for this family and we thank you for any help you can extend at this time of grief. Even if you are not in a position to help, please feel free to share this with your friends and family. Thanks for your support.
